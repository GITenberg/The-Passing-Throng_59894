  <i>The Passing Throng</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
From newsboy to the millionaire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing throng goes by each day;<br />
The old man with his weight of care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maiden in her colors gay,<br />
The mother with her babe in arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamer and the man of might,<br />
Grief's cruel scars and laughter's charms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass by the window, day and night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now slowly rides a corpse to find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave and its unbroken sleep,<br />
And in the carriages behind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A score of sorrowing loved ones weep;<br />
But scarcely has the hearse passed by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its journey to the tomb,<br />
When, wreathed with smiles of love, we spy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of a bride and groom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We cannot understand it all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot know why this is so;<br />
From dawn until night's curtains fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the people come and go.<br />
Hope lights the eyes of youth to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow care has left them dim;<br />
Once this man proudly walked his way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now defeat has broken him.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Could we but watch, as God must do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd see the struggling youth arise,<br />
We'd see him brave his dangers through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reach his goal and claim the prize.<br />
And we might judge with gentler sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken lives, which come and go,<br />
And better choose 'twixt wrong and right&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could know what God must know.<br />
</p>

<i>Wife o' Mine</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Wife o' Mine, day after day<br />
Cheering me along the way;<br />
Patient, tender, smiling, true,<br />
Always ready to renew<br />
Faltering courage and to share<br />
All the day may bring of care;<br />
Dreaming dreams wherein you see<br />
Brighter years that are to be;<br />
Calling paltry pleasures fine&mdash;<br />
That's you always, Wife o' Mine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Wife o' Mine, we've shed some tears<br />
With the passing of the years,<br />
Mourned beside our lovely dead;<br />
But somehow you've always said<br />
You and I could bear the blow<br />
Knowing God had willed it so;<br />
And you've smiled to show to me<br />
Just how brave you meant to be,<br />
Smiled to keep my faith in line&mdash;<br />
That's you, always, Wife o' Mine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Wife o' Mine, long years ago<br />
Once I promised you would know<br />
Luxuries and costly things,<br />
Gowns of silk and jeweled rings,<br />
And you laughed as though you knew<br />
Dreams like that could not come true;<br />
Now perhaps they never will,<br />
But I see you laughing still,<br />
Welcoming me with eyes that shine&mdash;<br />
That's you always, Wife o' Mine.<br />

<i>Let's Be Brave</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Let's be brave when the laughter dies<br />
And the tears come into our troubled eyes,<br />
Let's cling to the faith and the old belief<br />
When the skies grow gray with the clouds of grief,<br />
Let's bear the sorrow and hurt and pain<br />
And wait till the laughter comes again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Let's be brave when the trials come<br />
And our hearts are sad and our lips are dumb,<br />
Let's strengthen ourselves in the times of test<br />
By whispering softly that God knows best;<br />
Let us still believe, though we cannot know,<br />
We shall learn sometime it is better so.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Let's be brave when the joy departs<br />
Till peace shall come to our troubled hearts,<br />
For the tears must fall and the rain come down<br />
And each brow be pressed to the thorny crown;<br />
Yet after the dark shall the sun arise,<br />
So let's be brave when the laughter dies.<br />

<i>Boy or Girl?</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Some folks pray for a boy, and some<br />
For a golden-haired little girl to come.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some claim to think there is more of joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped up in the smile of a little boy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others pretend that the silky curls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plump, pink cheeks of the little girls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring more of bliss to the old home place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a small boy's queer little freckled face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now which is better, I couldn't say<br />
If the Lord should ask me to choose to-day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If He should put in a call for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say: "Now what shall your order be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy or girl?  I have both in store&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the two are you waiting for?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd say with one of my broadest grins:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send either one, if it can't be twins."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I've heard it said, to some people's shame,<br />
They cried with grief when a small boy came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they wanted a girl.  And some folks I know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wanted a boy, just took on so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a girl was sent.  But it seems to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mothers and fathers should happy be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think, when the Stork has come and gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Lord would trust them with either one.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Boy or girl?  There can be no choice;<br />
There's something lovely in either voice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that I ask of the Lord to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is to see that the mother comes safely through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guard the baby and have it well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a perfect form and a healthy yell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pair of eyes and a shock of hair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, boy or girl&mdash;and its dad won't care.<br />

<i>They're Waiting Over There</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
They're waiting for us over there;<br />
The young, the beautiful and fair<br />
Who left us, oh, so long ago,<br />
Lonely and hurt on earth below,<br />
Are waiting bravely, never fear,<br />
Until our faces shall appear.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then, when our journey here is done,<br />
And we set out to follow on<br />
Through the great, heavy mantled door<br />
Which leads to rest forevermore,<br />
They will be there to laugh away<br />
The loneliness we feel to-day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
They'll welcome us with wondrous grace,<br />
And show us all about the place;<br />
They'll take us gently by the hand<br />
And guide us through that radiant land;<br />
They'll tell us all they've learned and seen<br />
Through the long absence that has been.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We'll meet the friends who have been kind<br />
To them the while we stayed behind&mdash;<br />
Angels who long have dwelt above,<br />
Who welcomed them with arms of love,<br />
And sheltered them the long years through,<br />
Just as we'd prayed for them to do.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Though now you mourn, who stay behind,<br />
How sad 'twould be to leave, and find<br />
Upon that distant other shore<br />
No loved one who had gone before&mdash;<br />
The gates of Heaven to enter through<br />
With no one there to welcome you.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
As now, when some long journey ends<br />
And we're received by smiling friends<br />
Who've watched and waited for our train,<br />
So shall they welcome us again;<br />
The young, the beautiful and fair<br />
Will all be waiting for us there.<br />

<i>Visitors</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We've had a lot of visitors, it seems, for weeks an' weeks,<br />
And Pa is gettin' all run down.  Ma says that when he speaks<br />
He isn't civil any more.  He mopes around the place<br />
And always seems to wear a look of sadness on his face.<br />
And yesterday he said to Ma when she began to fuss:<br />
"I wonder when they're going to quit an' leave the home to us.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"It's nice to have your people come, but some of them should go;<br />
Instead of that they're sticking here like bull dogs at a show.<br />
'The more the merrier,' they shout, as other ones drop in.<br />
I'm getting so I cannot stand to see your cousins grin<br />
And, what is more, I'm getting tired of driving folks about<br />
And mighty tired of visitors who must be taken out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Night after night when I've come home I've hauled them near and far,<br />
You'd think I was the driver of a town sight-seeing car.<br />
I've hauled them up to factories and monuments and parks,<br />
Museums and aquariums; I've shown 'em seals and sharks<br />
And bears and wolves and elephants; and now I want to quit.<br />
I know they'd do the same for me, but I am sick of it.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I wouldn't say a word at all about your folks, I know<br />
They're just as nice as they can be, but still I wish they'd go.<br />
I'm tired of all the buzz and talk, the tales of those who've died;<br />
I'm tired of seeing all our chairs forever occupied."<br />
"And I am tired myself," said Ma, "as tired as I can be,<br />
You're only on the job at night, but it's all day long for me."<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
Pa never gets a story straight.<br />
He's always mixed about the date,<br />
Or where it was, or what occurred,<br />
Or who related what he heard;<br />
And every time he starts to tell<br />
Some little story he knows well,<br />
Ma says: "No, Pa, as I recall,<br />
That isn't how it was at all."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Remember when I broke my arm,"<br />
Says Pa, "when we were on the farm<br />
And I went out that slippery morn<br />
A few days after Bud was born,<br />
To get some wood"&mdash;and Ma says then:<br />
"Oh, Pa, don't tell that tale again!<br />
And anyhow, I know right well<br />
Bud wasn't born the day you fell."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Twas months before he came," says Ma.<br />
"'Twas after he was born," says Pa;<br />
"I rather think I ought to know<br />
Just when it was I suffered so."<br />
"Maybe you ought," says Ma, "but still,<br />
I saw you tumble down the hill,<br />
And it was March with snow drifts high&mdash;<br />
Bud wasn't born till next July."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I'd walk him round the floor," says Pa.<br />
"You're all mixed up again," says Ma.<br />
"We'll ask Aunt Lizzie, she was there,<br />
She'd come to help."  Says Ma: "I swear<br />
You're just as crazy as a loon,<br />
Aunt Lizzie didn't come till June.<br />
To argue on is most absurd,<br />
Bud wasn't born when that occurred."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I wish I knew just what is what<br />
Or whether I was born or not,<br />
But I'll just have to sit and wait<br />
Until Pa gets his story straight;<br />
And I have never heard at all<br />
Just how it was he chanced to fall,<br />
For Pa and Ma can't yet agree<br />
Which one came first&mdash;the fall or me.<br />

<i>The Spirit of the Home</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Dishes to wash and clothes to mend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And always another meal to plan,<br />
Never the tasks of a mother end<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, so early her day began!<br />
Floors to sweep and the pies to bake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chairs to dust and the beds to make.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh, the home is fair when you come at night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meal is good and the children gay,<br />
And the kettle sings in its glad delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mother smiles in her gentle way;<br />
So great her love that you seldom see<br />
Or catch a hint of the drudgery.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Home, you say, when the day is done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home to comfort and peace and rest;<br />
Home, where the children romp and run&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the place that you love the best!<br />
Yet what would the home be like if you<br />
Had all of its endless tasks to do?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Would it be home if she were not there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave and gentle and fond and true?<br />
Could you so fragrant a meal prepare?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you the numberless duties do?<br />
What were the home that you love so much,<br />
Lacking her presence and gracious touch?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
She is the spirit of all that's fair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the home that you think you build;<br />
She is the beauty you dream of there;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the laughter with which it's filled&mdash;<br />
She, with her love and her gentle smile,<br />
Is all that maketh the home worth while.<br />

<i>If I Were Sending My Boy Afar</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If I were sending my boy afar<br />
To live and labor where strangers are,<br />
I should hold him close till the time to go,<br />
Telling him things which he ought to know;<br />
I should whisper counsel and caution wise,<br />
Hinting of dangers which might arise,<br />
And tell him the things I have learned from life,<br />
Of its bitter pain and its cruel strife<br />
And the sore temptations which men beset,<br />
And then add this: "Boy, don't forget<br />
When your strength gives out and your hope grows dim,<br />
Your father will help if you'll come to him."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If I were sending a boy away,<br />
I should hold him close on the parting day<br />
And give him my trust.  Through thick and thin<br />
I should tell him I counted on him to win,<br />
To keep his word at whatever cost,<br />
To play the man though his fight be lost.<br />
But beyond all that I should whisper low:<br />
"If trouble comes, let your father know;<br />
Come to him, son, as you used to do<br />
When you were little&mdash;he'll see you through.<br />
I am trusting you in a distant land.<br />
You trust your father to understand.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Trust me wherever you chance to be,<br />
Know there is nothing to hide from me,<br />
Tell me it all&mdash;your tale of woe,<br />
The sting of failure that hurts you so.<br />
Never, whatever your plight may be,<br />
Think it something to hide from me;<br />
Come to me first in your hour of need,<br />
Come though you know that my heart will bleed!<br />
Boy, when the shadows of trouble fall,<br />
Come to your father first of all."<br />

<i>The White Oak</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The white oak keeps its leaves till spring when other trees are bare,<br />
And who will take the time to look, will find the young bud there;<br />
The young bud nestled snug and warm against the winter's cold;<br />
The young bud being sheltered by the knowledge of the old.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
And when the spring shall come again&mdash;and gentle turns the day,<br />
The youthful bud will swell with strength and thrust the old away;<br />
The youthful bud will seek the breeze and hunger for the sun,<br />
And down to earth will fall the old with all its duty done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then, heedless of the parent leaf, the youthful bud will grow<br />
And watch the robins build their nests and watch the robins go.<br />
Then something strange will come to it when that young leaf grows old,<br />
It, too, will want to shield its babe against the winter's cold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It, too, will cling unto the tree through many a dreary day<br />
Until the spring-time comes again and it is thrust away;<br />
Then it will flutter down to earth with all its duty done,<br />
And leave behind its happy child to drink the morning sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
How like man's life from birth to close!  How like the white oak tree<br />
Which keeps a shelter for its young against the storms, are we!<br />
We guard our children through the night and watch them through the day,<br />
And when at last our work is done, like leaves, we fall away.<br />

<i>Dirty Hands</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I have to wash myself at night before I go to bed,<br />
An' wash again when I get up, and wash before I'm fed,<br />
An' Ma inspects my neck an' ears an' Pa my hands an' shirt&mdash;<br />
They seem to wonder why it is that I'm so fond of dirt.<br />
But Bill&mdash;my chum&mdash;an' I agree that we have never seen<br />
A feller doing anything whose hands were white an' clean.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Bill's mother scolds the same as mine an' calls him in from play<br />
To make him wash his face an' hands a dozen times a day.<br />
Dirt seems to worry mothers so.  But when the plumber comes<br />
To fix the pipes, it's plain to see he never scrubs his thumbs;<br />
His clothes are always thick with grease, his face is smeared with dirt,<br />
An' he is not ashamed to show the smudges on his shirt.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The motorman who runs the car has hands much worse than mine,<br />
An' I have noticed when we ride there's dirt in every line.<br />
The carpenter who works around our house can mend a chair<br />
Or put up shelves or fix the floor, an' mother doesn't care<br />
That he's not in his Sunday best; she never interferes<br />
An' makes him stop his work to go upstairs to wash his ears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The fellers really doing things, as far as I can see.<br />
Have hands and necks and ears that are as dirty as can be.<br />
The man who fixes father's car when he can't make it go,<br />
Most always has a smudgy face&mdash;his hands aren't white as snow.<br />
But I must wash an' wash an' wash while everybody knows<br />
The most important men in town have dirty hands and clo'es.<br />

<i>If I Were a Boss</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If I were a boss I would like to say:<br />
"You did a good job here yesterday."<br />
I'd look for a man, or a girl, or boy<br />
Whose heart would leap with a thrill of joy<br />
At a word of praise, and I'd pass it out<br />
Where the crowd could hear as I walked about.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If I were the boss I would like to find<br />
The fellow whose work is the proper kind;<br />
And whenever to me a good thing came,<br />
I'd ask to be told the toiler's name,<br />
And I'd go to him and I'd pat his back<br />
And I'd say: "That was perfectly splendid, Jack!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now a bit of praise isn't much to give,<br />
But it's dear to the hearts of all who live;<br />
And there's never a man on this good old earth<br />
But is glad to be told that he's been of worth;<br />
And a kindly word when the work is fair<br />
Is welcomed and wanted everywhere.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If I were a boss, I am sure I should<br />
Say a kindly word whenever I could,<br />
For the man who has given his best by day<br />
Wants a little more than his weekly pay;<br />
He likes to know, with the setting sun,<br />
That his boss is pleased with the work he's done.<br />

<p class="poem">
You know your mother&mdash;that's plain as day,<br />
But those wide blue eyes of you seem to say<br />
When I bend over your crib: "Now who<br />
Are you?"<br />
It's little figure I cut, I know,<br />
And faces trouble a baby so,<br />
But I'm the gladdest of all the glad&mdash;<br />
Your dad!<br />

You're two months old, and you see us smile,<br />
And I know you are wondering all the while<br />
Whoever on earth can these people be<br />

You've learned your mother; you know her well<br />
When hunger rattles the dinner bell,<br />
But somehow or other you cannot place<br />
My face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
As yet, I'm but one of the passing throng,<br />
The curious people who come along<br />
And pause at your crib, and you seem to say<br />
Each day:<br />
"I know one voice that is sweet to hear,<br />
I know her step when my mother's near,<br />
I know her wonderful smile&mdash;but who<br />
Are you?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"You always come with the same old grin,<br />
Your finger's rough when you tickle my chin,<br />
But you run away when I start to cry,<br />
And I<br />
Don't understand when visitors call<br />
Why you're so afraid they will let me fall.<br />
You are the queerest of all the queer<br />
Folks here!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It's true that over your crib I stand<br />
And tickle your chin with my rough old hand.<br />
And I run away when you start to cry,<br />
But I<br />
Have a right to my queer little funny ways,<br />
To boast your worth and to sound your praise,<br />
For I am the gladdest of all the glad&mdash;<br />

<i>His Work</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There isn't much fame on a farm, an' the farm doesn't pile up the wealth;<br />
It gives you an appetite early an' late, an' it's usually lavish with health.<br />
The world travels by in its cars, but the men and the women don't see<br />
Any reason to cheer anything that I do or pin any medals on me;<br />
But I'm doin' my work just the same an' at night-time the Lord an' I know<br />
That the wheat's lookin' fine in the acres out there, and I&mdash;well, I helped it to grow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Sometimes I get gloomy an' blue an' wish I could rise with the great,<br />
An' wish I could point something out which my hands have builded or helped to create;<br />
Then the orchard looks over to me an' the fruit-laden trees seem to say,<br />
"If it were not for you an' the care that you've given, we wouldn't be bearin' today."<br />
An' the acres of corn over there, I planted 'em all, row by row,<br />
"The good gift o' nature," the poets declare&mdash;but the Lord knows I helped it to grow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I reckon I'm fillin' my place, though workin' all day on the soil<br />
An' standin' the heat of the merciless sun isn't listed as glorious toil.<br />
There's little of brilliance here, an' there's nothin' to brag of; I guess<br />
A farmer's a farmer, an' that's all he is&mdash;an' his crops are his only success.<br />
But the Lord knows, an' I know it, too, as I plough or I harrow or hoe,<br />
That these fields would be barren of wheat an' of corn, if I hadn't helped 'em to grow.<br />

I've eaten chicken a la king<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a fancy dish,<br />
I think I've tasted everything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of man can wish;<br />
But nightly when we dine alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grateful praise I utter<br />
Unto that good old stand-by, known<br />

Some think it very common fare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And may be they are right,<br />
But I can take that wholesome pair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At morning, noon and night;<br />
And there's a happy thrill I feel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sets my heart a-flutter<br />
As I sit down to make a meal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mother's bread and butter.<br />

Though poets sing their favorite foods<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lilting lines and sweet,<br />
And each unto his different moods<br />

I still remain the little boy<br />

A youngster's gratitude and joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mother's bread and butter.<br />

So now, for all the joy I've had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such a wholesome pair<br />
Since first I was a little lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hunger's deep despair,<br />
I hold the finest food of all&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though epicures may sputter<br />
And sneer me from the banquet hall&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mother's bread and butter.<br />

<i>The Little Clothes Line</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The little clothes line by the kitchen door!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother stretched it once when I was young,<br />
And there the garments which the baby wore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each morning, very carefully, she hung.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Square bits of flannel fluttered in the breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White stockings very delicate and small,<br />
Long flowing dresses and the glad bootees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little blanket and a knitted shawl.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then came the day when mother took it down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we forgot what symbols fluttered there;<br />
We'd grown to breast the current of the town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight for conquest and to stand to care.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Ten years ago she smiled and said to me:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a little clothes line by the door."<br />
And there she hung, for all the world to see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various bits of raiment which he wore.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Even the ragman on his alley round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew, by the symbols fluttering on that line,<br />
That there a little baby would be found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And day by day he saw that glorious sign.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then boyhood came and called our babe away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscled him strong and turned his cheeks to brown,<br />
Gave him the strength to run and romp and play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she took the little clothes line down.<br />
</p>

To-day I sat beside her bed, and she<br />

<i>The Choir Boy</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
They put his spotless surplice on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tied his flowing tie,<br />
And he was fair to look upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he went singing by.<br />
He sang the hymns with gentle grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little lad of nine,<br />
For there was something in his face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seemed almost divine.<br />
</p>

His downcast eye was good to see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brow was smooth and fair,<br />
And no one dreamed that there could be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rascal plotting there;<br />
Yet when all heads in prayer were bowed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's gracious care to beg,<br />
The boy next to him cried aloud:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quit pinching o' my leg!"<br />

<p class="poem">
A pious little child he seemed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel born to sing;<br />
Beholding him, none ever dreamed<br />

Yet many a sudden "ouch!" proclaimed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he had smuggled in<br />
For mischief-making, unashamed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A most disturbing pin.<br />

<p class="poem">
And yet, I think, from high above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Father looking down,<br />

For in the spotless surplice white<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is his mother's joy,<br />
He knows he's not an angel bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just a healthy boy.<br />

  <i>The Lay of the Troubled Golfer</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
His eye was wild and his face was taut with anger and hate and rage,<br />
And the things he muttered were much too strong for the ink of the printed page.<br />
I found him there when the dusk came down, in his golf clothes still was he,<br />
And his clubs were strewn around his feet as he told his grief to me:<br />
"I'd an easy five for a seventy-nine&mdash;in sight of the golden goal&mdash;<br />
An easy five and I took an eight&mdash;an eight on the eighteenth hole!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I've dreamed my dreams of the 'seventy men,' and I've worked year after year,<br />
I have vowed I would stand with the chosen few ere the end of my golf career;<br />
I've cherished the thought of a seventy score, and the days have come and gone<br />
And I've never been close to the golden goal my heart was set upon.<br />
But today I stood on the eighteenth tee and counted that score of mine,<br />
And my pulses raced with the thrill of joy&mdash;I'd a five for a seventy-nine!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I can kick the ball from the eighteenth tee and get this hole in five,<br />
But I took the wood and I tried to cross that ditch with a mighty drive&mdash;"<br />
Let us end the quotes, it is best for all to imagine his language rich,<br />
But he topped that ball, as we often do, and the pill stopped in the ditch.<br />
His third was short and his fourth was bad and his fifth was off the line,<br />
And he took an eight on the eighteenth hole with a five for a seventy-nine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I gathered his clubs and I took his arm and alone in the locker room<br />
I left him sitting upon the bench, a picture of grief and gloom;<br />
And the last man came and took his shower and hurried upon his way,<br />
But still he sat with his head bowed down like one with a mind astray,<br />
And he counted his score card o'er and o'er and muttered this doleful whine:<br />
"I took an eight on the eighteenth hole, with a five for a seventy-nine!"<br />

<i>Peter and Paul</i><br />

<p class="poem">
Peter's the fellow I go to whenever Paul presses his claim.<br />
Peter is easy to deal with, Peter's not ready with blame;<br />
Paul has a way of insisting I shall be true to my word,<br />
And hints of a final accounting whenever a debt is incurred.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Peter is pleasant and smiling and ready to lend when he can;<br />
Paul offers counsel and caution and talks of the ways of a man,<br />
And whenever Paul's debts must be settled and I must return what I owe<br />
And haven't the money I promised, to borrow from Peter I go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But the more that I think about Peter, the greater my fancy for Paul,<br />
I know he'd be first to defend me if ever disaster should fall,<br />
For Peter thinks only of money and smilingly reckons his fee,<br />
While Paul, when he whispers of caution, thinks not of himself but of me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Paul would defend me from trouble, would shield and protect my renown,<br />
But Peter would add to my burdens and smilingly let me go down.<br />
Yes, Peter the pleasant would wreck me, and gloat when I rode to my fall,<br />
So the more that I learn about Peter, the greater my fondness for Paul.<br />

<i>A Fairy Story</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Sit here on my knee, little girl, and I'll tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A story to you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a fairy I knew<br />
Who lived in a garden when I was a child.<br />
She was lovely to see and whenever she smiled<br />
The sunbeams came dancing around just to know<br />
Whatever it was that was pleasing her so.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
She lived in a poppy and used to peek out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shout: "Oh, Yoo-hoo!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been waiting for you!"<br />
And then I'd go over to her house and play<br />
And she'd saddle a bee and we'd both ride away,<br />
Or sometimes we'd take a most wonderful trip<br />
With the sky for the sea and a cloud for our ship.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Oft my father and mother would look out and say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The glad little elf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plays there all by himself,<br />
And he comes in and tells us of things he has seen<br />
And the marvelous places to which he has been;<br />
He tells us of dining with princes and kings&mdash;<br />
It's a curious boy who can think up such things."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now this all occurred in the long years ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fairy has fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poppies are dead,<br />
And never again may I ride on a bee,<br />
Or sail on a cloud with the sky for the sea.<br />
But that fairy has promised, when poppies are fair,<br />
To come back again and to wait for you there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Yes, you can go out when the skies are all blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see what I've seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go where I've been.<br />
You can have fairies to lead you away,<br />
To show you strange sights and to share in your play;<br />
And the grown-ups may say that your fancies are wild,<br />
But fairies are real to an innocent child.<br />

Shoes<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I'll tell you it's a problem, when a youngster's nine years old,<br />
To keep his feet in leather and to keep him heeled<br />
and soled;
Just about the time I fancy I've some money I can use,<br />
His mother comes and tells me that he needs a pair of shoes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now I can wear a pair of shoes for several months or more,<br />
But Bud, it seems, is working for the man who keeps the store,<br />
And the rascal seems to fancy that his duty is to show<br />
How fast a healthy, rugged boy can wreck a leather toe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But shoes are made for romping in, for climbing and for fun,<br />
For kicking bricks and empty cans, and I am not the one<br />
To make him walk sedately in the way that grown-ups do&mdash;<br />
There's time enough for that, I say, when all his boyhood's through.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
So let him wreck them, heels and toes, and scuff their soles away,<br />
I'll not begrudge the bill for shoes that I'm compelled to pay,<br />
For I rejoice that it's my lot, when mother breaks the news,<br />
To have a healthy, roguish boy who's always needing shoes.<br />

<i>Football</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I'd rather fancied it would come, a healthy boy who's ten years old<br />
Forecasts the things he'll want to do without his secrets being told;<br />
And so last night when I got home and found his mother strangely still,<br />
I guessed somehow that mother love had battled with a youngster's will.<br />
"You'll have to settle it," said she; "there's nothing more that I can say,<br />
The game of football's calling him and he insists he wants to play."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We've talked it over many a time; we've hoped he wouldn't choose the game,<br />
And I suppose there's not a boy whose parents do not feel the same.<br />
They dread, as we, the rugged sport; they wonder, too, just what they'll say<br />
When son of theirs comes home, as ours, and begs to be allowed to play.<br />
And now the question's up to me, a question that I can't evade,<br />
But football is a manly game and I am glad he's not afraid.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He wants to play, he says to me; he knows the game is rough and grim,<br />
But worse than hurt and broken bones is what his friends will think of him;<br />
"They'd call me yellow," he explained, "if I stay out."  Of all things here<br />
There's nothing quite so hard to bear as is the heartless gibe or jeer,<br />
And though I cannot spare him pain or hurt when tackles knock him flat,<br />
Being his father, I've said "yes," because I choose to spare him that.<br />

  <i>She Never Gave Me a Chance</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
It happened that I came along as school was letting out<br />
And laughing boys and smiling girls raced everywhere about;<br />
But two there were who walked along the road in front of me<br />
And one young head was bowed to earth, a troubled lad was he;<br />
And as I stepped around the pair to hasten on my way:<br />
"She never gave a chance to me!" I heard the youngster say.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh, I have been a boy myself, and I have been to school<br />
And I have suffered punishment for breaking many a rule;<br />
I've worn the brand of mischief and been written down as bad,<br />
So I could reconstruct the scene&mdash;the teacher and the lad,<br />
The swift avenging punishment, the stern and angry glance,<br />
The blot of shame upon a boy sent home without a chance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I did not stop to ask the lad his little tale to tell,<br />
There was no need of that because I knew the story well&mdash;<br />
"She never gave a chance to me!" that sentence held it all.<br />
A hundred times I'd lived the scene in days when I was small,<br />
A broken rule, a teacher vexed, hot rage where calm belonged,<br />
A guilty judgment blindly made&mdash;a youngster sadly wronged.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I still can see that little chap upon his homeward way,<br />
"She never gave a chance to me," I still can hear him say,<br />
And so I write this verse for him, and all the girls and boys<br />
Who shall their tutors now and then disturb with needless noise.<br />
Be fair, you teachers of our land, in every circumstance;<br />
Don't let some little fellow say he never had a chance.<br />

A trinket small, and she will stand<br />

To see her daughter decked in gold&mdash;<br />

'Twould be a dreary world of thrift,<br />

This poem was chosen by Major General John

<p class="poem">
It was thick with Prussian troopers, it was foul with German guns;<br />
Every tree that cast a shadow was a sheltering place for Huns.<br />
Death was guarding every roadway, death was watching every field,<br />
And behind each rise of terrain was a rapid-fire concealed;<br />
Uncle Sam's Marines had orders: "Drive the Boche from where they're hid.<br />
For the honor of Old Glory, take the woods!"  And so they did.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I fancy none will tell it as the story should be told&mdash;<br />
None will ever do full justice to those Yankee troopers bold&mdash;<br />
How they crawled upon their stomachs through the fields of golden wheat,<br />
With the bullets spitting at them in that awful battle heat.<br />
It's a tale too big for writing; it's beyond the voice or pen,<br />
But it glows among the splendor of the bravest deeds of men.<br />

Inch by inch, they crawled to victory toward the flaming mouths of guns;<br />
Inch by inch, they crawled to grapple with the barricaded Huns;<br />
On through fields that death was sweeping with a murderous fire, they went<br />
Till the Teuton line was vanquished and the German strength was spent.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Ebbed and flowed the tides of battle, as they've seldom done before;<br />
Slowly, surely, moved the Yankees against all the odds of war.<br />
For the honor of the fallen, for the glory of the dead,<br />
The living line of courage kept the faith and moved ahead.<br />
They'd been ordered not to falter, and when night came on they stood<br />
With Old Glory proudly flying o'er the trees of Belleau Wood.<br />

<i>Partridge Time</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When Pa came home last night he had a package in his hand;<br />
"Now, Ma," said he, "I've something here which you will say is grand.<br />
A friend of mine got home to-day from hunting in the woods,<br />
He's been away a week or two, and got back with the goods.<br />
He had a corking string of birds&mdash;I wish you could have seen 'em!"<br />
"If you've brought any partridge home," said Ma, "you'll have to clean 'em."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Now listen, Ma," said Pa to her, "these birds are mighty rare.<br />
I know a lot of men who'd pay a heap to get a pair.<br />
But it's against the law to sell this splendid sort of game,<br />
And if you bought 'em you would have to use a different name.<br />
It isn't every couple has a pair to eat between 'em."<br />
"If you got any partridge there," says Ma, "you'll have to clean 'em."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Whenever kings want something fine, it's partridge that they eat,<br />
And millionaires prefer 'em, too, to any sort of meat.<br />
About us everywhere to-night are folks who'd think it fine<br />
If on a brace of partridge they could just sit down to dine.<br />
They've got a turkey skinned to death, they're sweeter than a chicken."<br />
"If that's what you've brought home," says Ma, "you'll have to do the pickin'."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
And then Pa took the paper off and showed Ma what he had.<br />
"There, look at those two beauties!  Don't they start you feelin' glad?<br />
An' ain't your mouth a-waterin' to think how fine they'll be<br />
When you've cooked 'em up for dinner, one for you an' one for me?"<br />
But Ma just turned her nose up high, an' said, when she had seen 'em,<br />
"You'll never live to eat 'em if you wait for me to clean 'em."<br />

<i>The Making of a Friend</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We nodded as we passed each day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled and went along our way;<br />
I knew his name, and he knew mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither of us made a sign<br />
That we possessed a common tie;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We barely spoke as we passed by.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
How fine he was I never guessed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid soul within his breast<br />
I never saw.  From me were hid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many kindly deeds he did.<br />
His gentle ways I didn't know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I'd have claimed him long ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then trouble came to me one day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was first to come and say<br />
The cheering words I longed to hear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He offered help, and standing near<br />
I felt our lives in sorrow blend&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My neighbor had become my friend.<br />

How many smiles from day to day<br />

<i>The Mortgage and the Man</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
This is the tale of a mortgage and a dead man and his son,<br />
A father who left to his only child a duty that must be done.<br />
And the neighbors said as they gathered round in the neighbor's curious way:<br />
"Too bad, too bad that he left his boy so heavy a debt to pay."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Day by day through the years that came, the mortgage held him fast&mdash;<br />
Straight and true to his task he went, and he paid the debt at last;<br />
And his arm grew strong and his eye kept bright, and although he never knew,<br />
The thing that fashioned a man of him was the task he had to do.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Honor and fortune crowned his brow till the day he came to die,<br />
But he said: "My boy shall never work against such odds as I.<br />
I have planned his years, I have made them safe, I have paid his journey through."<br />
And the boy looked out on a world wherein there was nothing for him to do.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
His hands grew soft and his eyes went dull and his cheeks turned ashy pale,<br />
For strength which isn't employed by day, with idleness grows stale.<br />
"He is not the man that his father was," the neighbors often said,<br />
"And better for him had he been left to work for his meat and bread."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh, the race dies out and the clan departs, and feeble grows the son<br />
When they come at last to the dreadful day when all of the work is done.<br />
For manhood dies on the roads of ease where the skies are ever blue,<br />
And each of us needs, if we shall grow strong, some difficult thing to do.<br />

<i>The Training of Jimmy McBride</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Jimmy McBride was a common sense lad,<br />
The son of a common sense mother and dad<br />
Who had borne him and bred him to labor.<br />
He'd been taught what a common sense lad understands,<br />
That the Lord in His wisdom had given him hands<br />
For handling a pick or a sabre.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Your feet are for walking," his father once said,<br />
"To see with, God gave you two eyes in your head,<br />
And your mouth is for eating and drinking;<br />
And that you'll remember I'm making it plain,<br />
You've also been given what men call a brain,<br />
And the brain is put in there for thinking.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Now you've all the equipment the greatest possess,<br />
And some men have risen to glory with less,<br />
So don't be afraid, but go to it;<br />
If it's honest, and useful, and ought to be done,<br />
Don't think it beneath you, but jump in, my son&mdash;<br />
Go straight to your duty and do it."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When Jimmy came home with the dirt on his face<br />
They never once said: "It's a shame and disgrace!<br />
Poor boy, you are worn out and weary!"<br />
No pity for Jimmy his labors inspired.<br />
His old father said: "It is sweet to be tired,<br />
It makes the home-coming so cheery."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
His old mother said with the pride in her eye,<br />
"There's nothing like work to put flavor in pie.<br />
Come in and sit down to your dinner."<br />
And they said to themselves when he'd gone to his bed,<br />
"He's earning his way and he's forging ahead&mdash;<br />
Our Jimmy McBride is a winner."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
And when their old age came upon them at last,<br />
No touch of regret stole the joy from the past,<br />
Nor envy of happier neighbor.<br />
And they thanked the good Lord who had sent them their Jim<br />
That they'd had the wisdom in dealing with him<br />
To teach him the value of labor.<br />

<i>The Way of a Wife</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
She wasn't hungry, so she said.  A salad and a cup of tea<br />
Was all she felt that she could eat, but it was different with me.<br />
"I'm rather hungry," I replied: "if you don't mind, I think I'll take<br />
Some oysters to begin with and a good old-fashioned sirloin steak."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now wives are curious in this; to make the statement blunt and straight,<br />
There's nothing tempts their appetites like food upon another's plate;<br />
And when those oysters six appeared she looked at them and said to me,<br />
"Just let me try one, will you, dear?" and right away she swallowed three.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
On came the steak, and promptly she exclaimed: "Oh my, that looks so good!<br />
I think I'd like a bit of it."  The game is one I understood.<br />
I cut her off a healthy piece and never whimpered when she said:<br />
"Now just a few potatoes, dear, and also let me share your bread."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
She wasn't hungry!  She'd refused the food I had been glad to buy,<br />
But on the meal which came for me, I know she turned a hungry eye.<br />
She never cares for much to eat, she's dainty in her choice, I'll state,<br />
But she gets ravenous enough to eat whatever's on my plate.<br />

  <i>Beneath the Dirt</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
He'd been delivering a load of coal, and a five-ton truck he steered;<br />
He wasn't a pretty sight to see with his four days' growth of beard.<br />
His clothes were such as a coal man wears, and the fine folks passing by<br />
Would have scorned the touch of his dirty hands and the look in his weary eye.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He rattled and banged along the road, sick of his job, no doubt,<br />
When in front of his truck, from a hidden spot, a dog and a child dashed out<br />
And he couldn't stop, so he made one leap from the height of his driver's seat<br />
And he caught the child with those dirty hands and swept her from the street.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Over his legs went the heavy wheels, and they picked him up for dead,<br />
And the rich man's wife placed her sable coat as a pillow for his head.<br />
And black as he was, the rich man said: "He shall travel home with me."<br />
And he sat by his side in the limousine and was proud of his company.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
You may walk in pride in your garments fine, you may judge by the things of show,<br />
But what's deep in the breast of the man you scorn is something you cannot know.<br />

If to save the life of the child you love, he had bravely risked his own.<br />

The time I played with Vardon, I was surely on my game,<br />

I was driving right with Harry, and was getting home in two,<br />
And every trick that Vardon tried, I showed that I could do;<br />
I had the Briton worried&mdash;I could tell it from his look,<br />
For I was doing everything he'd printed in his book.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I'd held him level several holes, and then the crowd began,<br />
In a fever of excitement, to applaud me to a man;<br />
Men were whispering together, "Eddie's surely right today&mdash;<br />
He is just as good as Vardon!  Oh, it's great to watch him play!"<br />
Then Vardon tried a long one, but his ball just missed the cup,<br />
And I dropped my twenty-footer for a birdie and was up!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Nip-and-tuck out there we battled, and I ventured soon to guess<br />
If I could keep it going, I'd make Mr. Vardon press;<br />
He was very nice about it, but when I'd got home in two<br />
I noticed he was lunging like I often used to do.<br />
Then he dubbed a shot completely, when I'd played a perfect cleek,<br />
And I whispered to my caddie: "Vardon sometimes takes a peek!"<br />

I was just one up on Vardon on the good old eighteenth tee,<br />
And a half was all I needed for my greatest victory.<br />
I was confident of winning&mdash;calm and cool about it, too;<br />

I looked the distance over, then I made a perfect stroke&mdash;<br />
But just then the missus shook me, and confound it!  I awoke!<br />

<p class="poem">
The other night 'bout two o'clock, or maybe it was three,<br />
An elephant with shining tusks came chasing after me.<br />
His trunk was wavin' in the air an' spoutin' jets of steam<br />
An' he was out to eat me up, but still I didn't scream<br />
Or let him see that I was scared&mdash;a better thought I had,<br />
I just escaped from where I was and crawled in bed with dad.<br />

One time there was a giant who was horrible to see,<br />
He had three heads and twenty arms, an' he come after me<br />
And red hot fire came from his mouths and every hand was red<br />
And he declared he'd grind my bones and make them into bread.<br />
But I was just too smart for him, I fooled him mighty bad,<br />
Before his hands could collar me I crawled in bed with dad.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I ain't scared of nothing that comes pesterin' me at night.<br />
Once I was chased by forty ghosts all shimmery an' white,<br />
An' I just raced 'em round the room an' let 'em think maybe<br />
I'd have to stop an' rest awhile, when they could capture me.<br />
Then when they leapt onto my bed, Oh Gee! but they were mad<br />
To find that I had slipped away an' crawled in bed with dad.<br />

No giants, ghosts or elephants have dared to come in there<br />
'Coz if they did he'd beat 'em up and chase 'em to their lair.<br />

An' laugh if they can make 'em yell for help with all their might,<br />
But I don't ever yell out loud.  I'm not that sort of lad,<br />

When melancholy rides the sky and fills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance with her dust of gloom and doubt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from despair there seems no gateway out;<br />
When the cold blast of disappointment chills<br />
The green young buds of hope and the once rosy hills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand gaunt, forbidding battlements, too stout<br />
For faltering strength to master, ere it kills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith in high purpose, turn your face about.<br />

Search the great past, the ages that have gone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause and reflect by some remembered grave;<br />
At Valley Forge once more with Washington,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn what it means to suffer and be brave.<br />
Or stand with patient Lincoln and believe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That what is right, its purpose shall achieve.<br />

<i>The Waiter</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I met him in a college town, a youngster with a grin,<br />
And he was sweeping up the floor when I was ushered in.<br />
When I had registered my name, he put aside his broom<br />
To grab my suitcase from the floor and show me to my room.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
That night at dinner I beheld that youngster at my side,<br />
"We've pork and lamb," said he to me, "potatoes, baked or fried."<br />
When I had made my choice of food, he gayly went away<br />
And when he next appeared he had my dinner on a tray.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"So you're a waiter too?" said I.  He chuckled soft and low:<br />
"Three times a day it is my job the dishes round to throw.<br />
I'm bell hop in the afternoons, between times I'm the clerk,<br />
But I can get my lessons when I've finished up my work.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I'm on my way through college, and I'm paying for it here,<br />
Some day I'll chuck this job and be a civil engineer.<br />
I want an education, and the only way I had<br />
Was to come and be a waiter, for I haven't any dad."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I don't know how to say it, but some day I know I'll hear,<br />
If I still am with the living, of a civil engineer<br />
Who has earned his way to glory, and I'll smile at his renown<br />
And say: "There stands the waiter of that little college town."<br />

<i>A Man Must Want</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It's wanting keeps us young and fit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's wanting something just ahead<br />
And striving hard to come to it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brightens every road we tread.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
That man is old before his time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is supremely satisfied<br />
And does not want some hill to climb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something life has still denied.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The want of poverty is grim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a harsh and cruel sting,<br />
But fill the cup up to the brim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's a far more hopeless thing.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
A man must want from day to day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must want to reach a distant goal<br />
Or claim some treasure far away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want's the builder of the soul.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He who has ceased to want has dropped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working tools of life and stands<br />
Much like an old-time clock that's stopped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Time is mouldering his hands.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I'm truly sorry for the man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he be millionaire or king,<br />
Who does not hold some cherished plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And says he does not want a thing.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Want is the spur that drives us on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft its praises should be sung,<br />
For man is old when want is gone&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's what we want that keeps us young.<br />

  <i>Abe Lincoln</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
Bill and Jim drove into town on a pleasant summer day,<br />
Puffed their pipes and talked of things in a friendly sort of way,<br />
Talked of crops and politics, neighbors and the price of nails,<br />
Then, as they were jogging on, passed a fellow splitting rails.<br />
"Who's that yonder, Bill?" says Jim, "I don't seem to know his face."<br />
"That's Abe Lincoln," answered Bill&mdash;"got a shabby sort of place."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Lawsuit going on one day, Bill and Jim had time to spare,<br />
Dropped into the court awhile, found most all their neighbors there.<br />
"Moonlight night," one witness said&mdash;prisoner's chances mighty small,<br />
Till his lawyer rose and proved there wasn't any moon at all.<br />
"Who's defending him?" says Jim, "rather clever, I should say."<br />
"That's Abe Lincoln," answered Bill, "homely as a bale of hay."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Politics was getting hot, meetings almost every night,<br />
Orators from north and south talking loudly for the right.<br />
Bill and Jim were always there cheering for their party's cause,<br />
Then one time a chap got up talking morals more than laws.<br />
"Who's that speaking now?" says Jim, "think I've seen his face before."<br />
"That's Abe Lincoln," answered Bill, "shall we go or hear some more?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Moral of it isn't much, greatness may be round about,<br />
But when seen from day to day men are slow to find it out.<br />
Those who saw him splitting rails, those who heard him plead a case<br />
Passed him by with little thought, laughing at his homely face.<br />
Those who neighbored with the boy, those who saw his summer tan,<br />
Those who lived in Lincoln's time never really knew the man.<br />

<p class="poem">
Bill is a mushroom expert, and Bill is a friend of mine,<br />
He has studied the amanita and all its ancestral line;<br />
He goes to the fields each autumn to harvest a dinner treat<br />
For he knows which are deadly fungi, and which are the ones to eat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Bill can talk by the hour on mushrooms and he laughs at my timid fears,<br />
He is still in the land of the living and has eaten the things for years;<br />
He is wise in the lore of the meadow, the swamp and the dark ravine,<br />
And I'd say, of the mushroom experts, he's the best that I've ever seen.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If ever I gathered mushrooms I'd carry them back to Bill<br />
And ask him to look them over and pick out the ones that kill;<br />
I'd trust to his certain knowledge and bank on his judgment, too,<br />
For he is a shark on that stuff and can spiel it right off to you.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Bill knows 'em and loves 'em and eats 'em, and all through the days of fall<br />
He's out with his little basket in search of the snowy ball;<br />
And never I doubt his knowledge, I grant it surpasses mine&mdash;<br />
But during the mushroom season I don't go to Bill's to dine.<br />

Used to think I'd like to go<br />
To the town I used to know<br />

Tanned of cheek an' always glad.<br />
But it's been so long since I<br />
Told the good old friends good-bye<br />
An' set out for wealth an' fame,<br />

Moved away or traveled on<br />
To a brighter realm than this;<br />
An' the girls we used to kiss<br />
An' go courtin' with, somehow<br />
Don't seem half so pretty now.<br />

<p class="poem">
Folks have told me that the farm<br />
Where I lived has lost its charm<br />
An' they've paved the dusty street<br />
Which was velvet to our feet,<br />
An' it's now a thoroughfare<br />
With the hum of motors there;<br />
Wouldn't want to lose the joy<br />
That I've treasured from a boy&mdash;<br />
Guess I'd better keep always<br />
Memories of those happier days.<br />

<p class="poem">
I'm afraid of goin' back.<br />
Memory still keeps the track<br />
To those favorite haunts of mine<br />
Like a painted canvas fine,<br />
An' the old spots live with me<br />
Just the way they used to be;<br />
An' to see them now would seem<br />
Much like shattering a dream,<br />
So the town shall live with me<br />
Just the way it used to be.<br />

<i>The Driver of the Truck</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I envy him his care-free way, I envy him his smile,<br />
The highway is his own domain, he rules it every mile;<br />
The king who drives about by day, sends couriers on ahead<br />
And buglers gay and soldiers brave, a path for him to spread;<br />
But he may go his way alone nor fear that he'll be struck,<br />
For monarch of the highway is the driver of the truck.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When I go driving down the road I must obey the rules,<br />
I must watch out for all who come, the sane men and the fools,<br />
And I must guard that car of mine with vigilance and care,<br />
For even trifling accidents might strand me then and there;<br />
But let who will bump into him, he's never out of luck,<br />
No pleasure car can ever stop the driver of the truck.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He sits his seat in confidence, serene and quite content,<br />
His heavy wheels are never dished, his axles never bent;<br />
A locomotive engineer might jolt him from his place,<br />
But nothing short of that would bring a tremor to his face.<br />
He laughs his cheerful way along, too big for men to buck,<br />
And even millionaires must dodge the driver of the truck.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh, kings and kaisers overthrown, who live in exile now,<br />
And princes of the royal blood whose heads have had to bow<br />
Before the people's mightier will, if you'd once more regain<br />

You still can make the lowly flee and force the throngs to duck&mdash;<br />
Just hustle out and get a job as driver of a truck.<br />

Since Pa put in the radio we have a lot of fun,<br />
We hustle to my room upstairs as soon as supper's done<br />
And Pa he tinkers with the discs to get it loud and clear,<br />
Then says: "Wait just a minute now, there's nothing yet to hear.<br />
Oh, now it's coming!  Silence there!  Now don't you move a thing.<br />
Say Ma, this is a marvelous age&mdash;a lady's going to sing!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then Ma she listens for awhile, as pleased as she can be<br />
And when I want to hear it, too, she says, "Don't bother me!<br />
Your turn comes next and sister's, too; don't jump around that way,<br />
I want to hear the orchestra&mdash;it's just begun to play.<br />
I wish you children wouldn't fuss, I'm sure I cannot hear<br />
While you are trying all the time to snatch it from my ear."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then Pa takes up the thing awhile and says: "Oh, that's just great!<br />
A man is telling stories now.  You kids will have to wait.<br />
It's wonderful to think his voice is floating in the air<br />
And people sitting in their homes can hear it everywhere&mdash;<br />
All right, all right!  It's your turn now.  Perhaps this man will teach<br />
You youngsters how you should behave.  A parson's going to preach."<br />

Pa put that radio in for me&mdash;at least he told me so,<br />
But if it's really mine or not, is something I don't know,<br />
'Coz Pa he wants it all himself, to hear the funny things,<br />
An' Ma must hear the concerts through when some great artist sings,<br />
But when the parson starts to talk on Selfishness an' Sin,<br />

<p class="poem">
It was a little yellow dog, a wistful thing to see,<br />
A homely, skinny, battered pup, as dirty as could be;<br />
His ribs were showing through his hide, his coat was thick with mud,<br />
And yet the way he wagged his tail completely captured Bud.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He had been kicked from door to door and stoned upon his way,<br />
"Begone!" was all he'd ever heard, 'twas all that folks would say;<br />
And yet this miserable cur, forever doomed to roam,<br />
Struck up a comradeship with Bud, who proudly brought him home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I've never seen so poor a dog in all my stretch of years,<br />
The burrs were thick upon his tail and thick upon his ears;<br />
He'd had to fight his way through life and carried many a scar,<br />
But still Bud brought him home and cried: "Say, can I keep him, Ma?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I think the homeless terrier knows that age is harsh and stern,<br />
And from the shabby things of life in scorn is quick to turn;<br />

A fairy and a robin met<br />
Beside a bed of mignonette.<br />
The robin bowed and raised his hat,<br />
And smiled a smile as wide as&mdash;that&mdash;<br />
Then said: "Miss Fairy, I declare,<br />
I'd kiss you, only I don't dare."<br />

And, oh, such pretty songs you sing&mdash;<br />
I'd gladly kiss you now, but I<br />
May only kiss a butterfly."<br />

The robin spoke a silly word:<br />
"I'm sorry I was born a bird!<br />
Were I a fairy-man instead,<br />
Then you and I might some day wed."<br />

God had to have some robins here.<br />

"Be glad you're what you are and sing<br />
And cheer the people in the Spring.<br />

I'm one the old folks never see."<br />

The robin spoke: "Perhaps it's best.<br />
I'll sing my songs and show my breast<br />

To do our duty&mdash;you and I."<br />

Too trifling for a chief to ask,<br />

No chance in that for splendor great,<br />
No chance to prove his gift of skill,<br />

And yet that wooden crate was filled<br />
With what had taken months to build.<br />

Just what was passing 'neath his hand&mdash;<br />
That as that wooden crate was nailed,<br />

That miles away men stood in wait<br />
Depending on that simple crate,<br />
For not a wheel could turn or drive<br />
Until it safely should arrive.<br />

<p class="poem">
He drove his nails, and let it go,<br />
Thinking that none would ever know<br />
Whose hand had held the hammer there<br />
Or, knowing it, would ever care;<br />
Yet in a few brief days there came<br />
The news that burned his cheeks with shame:<br />
"Broken in shipment and we stay<br />
Facing another month's delay."<br />

Vain is the skill of workmen great;<br />
Unless the boy who makes the crate<br />

On it depends the greater plan&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
October with its lovely breath<br />
Voices the cry: there is no death!<br />
Men read it in a thousand ways;<br />
We see beyond the mist and haze<br />
Which shroud the hills and valleys deep,<br />
That all shall wake who fall asleep.<br />

<i>Mother and the Styles</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Dresses high and dresses low,<br />
Fashion bids them come and go;<br />
Tresses bobbed and tresses long,<br />
Fashion sways the moving throng;<br />
What was new becomes the old,<br />
Thus this changing life is told.<br />
First we view it with a smile,<br />
Then adopt the latest style&mdash;<br />
But with all the passing days,<br />
Mothers never change their ways.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Gay of heart and bright of face,<br />
Fashion seems to rule the place.<br />
With the swinging of the clock<br />
Youth gives Age another shock,<br />
Flaunting into public view<br />
Something Age would never do,<br />
Laughing at us when we preach,<br />
Scornful of us when we teach&mdash;<br />
But with all of fashion's wiles,<br />
Mothers never change their styles.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Motherhood's no fickle thing,<br />
To be changed each fall and spring;<br />
As it was, so it remains,<br />
Spite of all its cares and pains.<br />
Joy may call and pleasure lure<br />
But a mother's love is pure,<br />
And the baby sinks to rest,<br />
Pillowed on her lovely breast,<br />
Closing little drowsy eyes<br />
To the softest lullabies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Mothers worry night and day<br />
When their children are away;<br />
Mothers grieve when they are ill,<br />
Always have and always will.<br />
They would shield you with their care<br />
Every day and every where,<br />
And they're happy through and through<br />
At the slightest smile from you&mdash;<br />
To the ending of their days<br />
Mothers never change their ways.<br />

<i>High Chair Days</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
High chair days are the best of all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so they seem to me,<br />
Days when tumbler and platter fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King smiles merrily;<br />
When the regal arms and the regal feet<br />
A constant patter of music beat,<br />
And the grown-ups bow in a gracious way<br />
To the high chair monarch who rules the day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
High chair days, and the throne not dressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In golden or purple hues<br />
But an old style thing, let it be confessed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His grandmother used to use;<br />
Its legs are scarred and a trifle bowed,<br />
But the king who sits on the chair is proud,<br />
And he throws his rattle and silver cup<br />
For the joy of making us pick them up.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The old high chair in the dining room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a handsomer thing by far<br />
Than the costly chairs in the lonely gloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the childless mansions are,<br />
For the sweetest laughter the world has known<br />
Comes day by day from that humble throne,<br />
And the happiest tables, morn and night,<br />
Have a high chair placed at the mother's right.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The old high chair is a joy sublime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it brings us its hour of pain,<br />
For we've put it away from time to time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps never to need again;<br />
Yet God was good, and the angles tapped,<br />
And again was the old high chair unwrapped,<br />
And proud was I when I heard the call<br />
To bring it back to the dining hall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There are griefs to meet and cares to face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the years that lie ahead;<br />
The proudest monarch must lose his place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lie with the splendid dead;<br />
I know there are blows I shall have to meet,<br />
I must pay with the bitter for all life's sweet,<br />
But I live in dread of that coming day<br />
When forever the high chair goes away.<br />

<i>Whooping Cough</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There is a reason, I suppose, for everything which comes&mdash;<br />
Why youngsters fall from apple trees and babies suck their thumbs;<br />
And though I can't explain it all, when trouble comes I know<br />
That since by Providence 'tis willed, it must be wiser so.<br />
But knowing this, I still insist we'd all be better off<br />
If little children could escape the dreaded whooping cough.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I never see a red-faced child in spasms violent<br />
But what I wonder why to babes such suffering is sent.<br />
Though mumps and measles, chicken pox and scarlet fever, too,<br />
Beset the lives of those I love, I still can see them through;<br />
But terror seems to chill my blood the minute that I hear<br />
That awful sign that someone's child with whooping cough is near.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Old women say it has to be, but I grow pale as death<br />
When I behold a boy or girl in anguish fight for breath.<br />
They tell me not to be alarmed, but I'm not made of steel,<br />
And every touch of agony the youngster has, I feel;<br />
And could I run this world of ours, the first thing I'd cut off<br />
From all the things which have to be, would be the whooping cough.<br />

<i>Over the Crib</i><br />

<p class="poem">
Over the crib where the baby lies,<br />
Countless beautiful visions rise<br />
Which only the mothers and fathers see,<br />
Pictures of laughter and joy and song<br />
As the years come sweeping us all along.<br />
Care seldom startles the happy eyes<br />
Over the crib where the baby lies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
A wonderful baby lying there!<br />
And strangers smile at the happy pair,<br />
Proud and boastful, for all they see<br />
Is the dimpled chin and the dimpled knee;<br />
But never a little one comes to earth<br />
That isn't a wonderful babe at birth,<br />
And never a mother who doesn't see<br />
Glorious visions of joy to be.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Over the crib where the baby lies,<br />
Dreams of splendor and pride arise,<br />
Deeds of valor and deeds of love<br />
Hover about and shine above<br />
The tiny form, and the future glows<br />
With a thousand dreams which the mother knows,<br />
And beauty dances before her eyes<br />
Over the crib where the baby lies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Yet we smile at her and we smile at him,<br />
For we are old and our eyes are dim<br />
And we have forgotten and don't recall<br />
Yet world-wide over the mothers dream<br />
The visions we saw when our babes were small,<br />
And ever they see in a golden stream,<br />
Wonderful joys in the by-and-by<br />
Over the cribs where their babies lie.<br />

  <i>Grass and Children</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
I used to want a lovely lawn, a level patch of green,<br />
For I have marveled many times at those that I have seen,<br />
And in my early dreams of youth the home that I should keep<br />
Possessed a lawn of beauty rare, a velvet carpet deep,<br />
But I have changed my mind since then&mdash;for then I didn't know<br />
That where the feet of children run the grass can never grow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now I might own a lovely lawn, but I should have to say<br />
To all the little ones about, "Go somewhere else to play!"<br />
And I should have to stretch a wire about my garden space<br />
And make the home where gladness reigns, a most forbidding place.<br />
By stopping all the merriment which now is ours to know,<br />
In time, beyond the slightest doubt, the tender grass would grow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But oh, I want the children near, and so I never say,<br />
When they are romping around the home, "Go somewhere else to play!"<br />
And though my lawn seems poorly kept, and many a spot is bare,<br />
I'd rather see, than growing grass, the youngsters happy there.<br />
I've put aside the dream I had in that far long ago&mdash;<br />
I'd rather have a playground than a place for grass to grow.<br />

<i>The Hills of Faith</i><br />

<p class="poem">
The hills are in the mist to-day,<br />
Their purple robes are put away.<br />
Like coast guards in their yellow coats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They face the driving rain;<br />
Like coast guards in their yellow coats,<br />
Who watch the sea for ship-wrecked boats,<br />
They watch the land for human craft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trouble on the plain.<br />

<p class="poem">
The gray clouds rush among their peaks,<br />
Some weakness there the storm-king seeks.<br />
A frightened boulder breaks away<br />

A tree is crushed to earth again,<br />
But staunch and brave the hills remain,<br />
A symbol of unfaltering faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the hosts of men.<br />

Time was the hills were tinged with gold,<br />
About them seas of crimson rolled,<br />

Who comes with blossoms in her hair.<br />
They laughed away the summer there,<br />
But now sublimely stern they stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attired in somber gray.<br />

Symbols of strength, unmoved they keep<br />
Their place against the winds that sweep;<br />
Defenders of our coast of faith,<br />

Shall breast the gale and live it through<br />
To greet the birth of spring again<br />

<p class="poem">
Last night the baby cried.  And I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roused from a sound and soothing sleep,<br />
Wondered to hear that little cry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ten long years in slumber deep<br />
I've lived my nights, and so it seemed<br />
That what I'd heard I'd only dreamed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
For ten long years a banging gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The milkman's whistle, or the horn<br />
Of motors driven at rapid rate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have wakened me at early dawn;<br />
But late last night awake was I,<br />
Thinking I'd heard a baby cry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I leaned upon my elbow there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wondered did I dream or not?<br />
But once again upon the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call came from her tiny cot!<br />
Then peacefully I turned and smiled<br />
To hear the crying of our child.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Lonely and still the house has seemed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ten long years, but once again<br />
We have the joy of which we'd dreamed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy which many seek in vain!<br />
Oh, happy, happy home, thought I,<br />
That wakes to hear a baby cry.<br />

<i>The True Critic</i><br />

<p class="poem">
There is one critic which a man should heed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strive with all his strength to satisfy;<br />
Whether it be in big or little deed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sits in judgment with a watchful eye.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
One voice there is which flatters not for gain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor censures honest effort as a pose,<br />
One voice which never speaks to cause us pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor seeks to tell the world how much it knows.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Yet if it tell us we have done our best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have kept the faith and labored to be true,<br />
We can lie down at night in peace to rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor mind what others say or think or do.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If but this eye which reads our inmost thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See no dishonor in the stand we take,<br />
If but this voice can praise the fight we've fought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not heed the storm that critics make.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If we but live with Conscience as our guide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rob the colder critics of their sting;<br />
If but that voice of us can speak in pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not heed the barbs which others fling.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If it can say we've truly done our best,<br />

To-day, if I were free, I think<br />
I'd wander to the river's brink<br />

Men write his cargo down as ore,<br />

The safe arrival of his freight.<br />

<i>The Luckless Fisherman</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
They laughed when I came home last night<br />
And said I didn't get a bite;<br />
They snickered an' they joked at me,<br />
And all the fellows asked to see<br />
The ones I'd caught, "Oho!" said they,<br />
"He's been out fishing all this day<br />
An' hasn't caught a single thing,<br />
He never got a fish to string."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
They laughed at me, but all their jeers<br />
Traveled no further than my ears.<br />
'Twas true I'd fished all day without<br />
Snaring a single speckled trout,<br />
But what of that?  I'd had a day<br />
That I could loaf and dream away,<br />
I'd chummed with birds and friendly trees<br />
And been as care-free as the breeze.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I'd rested wheresoe'er I'd willed,<br />
To me the hum of trade was stilled,<br />
I'd let my thoughts go wandering far<br />
To where life's happier glories are;<br />
I'd whistled like a boy once more,<br />
And even stretched full length on shore<br />
To watch the white clouds sail the blue,<br />
The very way I used to do.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
They laughed when I came home at night<br />
And said I didn't get a bite.<br />
They seemed to think my luck was bad.<br />
They couldn't guess the fun I'd had<br />
And couldn't know that all that day<br />
I'd been a free man, blithe and gay,<br />
And though of fish I'd landed none,<br />
I'd caught the joys for which I'd gone.<br />

  <i>Consolation</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
"It is all for the best," so they said<br />
As I stood by my dead.<br />
But I doubted the word<br />
That so often I heard;<br />
I could catch but the moan<br />
Of the mother, alone,<br />
And feel but the blow<br />
Which had stricken us so.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Why," I cried, "should it be<br />
God must so punish me?<br />
Why should my baby die<br />
When are hundreds near by,<br />
Old and feeble of breath,<br />
Waiting only for death?"<br />
And they answered me low:<br />
"God has ordered it so."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But to-day, through the years<br />
That have ended our tears,<br />
We have memories rare<br />
That no others may share;<br />
We can look back and see<br />
Why the blow had to be&mdash;<br />
By that mound and its sod,<br />
We are closer to God.<br />

If it's worth while, then it's worth a few blows,<br />

<i>The Letter</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The postman whistled down the street<br />
And seemed to walk on lighter feet,<br />
And as he stepped inside her gate<br />
He knew he carried precious freight;<br />
He knew that day he carried joy&mdash;<br />
He had the letter from her boy.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Day after day he'd kept his pace<br />
And seen her careworn, gentle face.<br />
She watched for him to come and took<br />
The papers with an anxious look,<br />
But disappointment followed hope&mdash;<br />
She missed the one glad envelope.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He stopped to chat with her awhile<br />
And saw the sadness of her smile,<br />
He fancied he could hear her sigh<br />
The morning that he traveled by;<br />
He knew that when to-morrow came<br />
She would be waiting just the same.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The boy who was so far away<br />
Could never hear her gently say:<br />
"Well, have you brought good news to me?"<br />
Her eager face he could not see,<br />
Or note the lines of anxious care<br />
As every day she waited there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But when he wrote, on lighter feet<br />
The happy postman walked the street.<br />
"Well, here it is, at last," he'd shout,<br />
"To end the worry and the doubt."<br />
The robin on the maple limb<br />
Began to sing: "She's heard from him."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Her eyes with joy began to glow,<br />
The neighbors round her seemed to know<br />
That with the postman at the door<br />
Sweet peace had come to her once more.<br />
When letters bring so much delight,<br />
Why do the sons forget to write?<br />

<i>The Tower Clock</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Day after day the clock in the tower<br />
Strikes on its resonant bell, the hour.<br />
Telling the throngs in the city block<br />
Once again it's ten o'clock!<br />
Day after day, and the crowds pass on,<br />
Till they and another hour have gone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I heard it first as an eager lad,<br />
The largest clock which the city had,<br />
And it rang the hour in the self-same way<br />
That it rings it out for the town to-day,<br />
And many who heard it then have gone,<br />
Gone like the days that have journeyed on.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Mighty and many the throngs have grown,<br />
Many the changes the town has known,<br />
But the old clock still in its tower stands,<br />
Telling the hour with its silent hands;<br />
And the great pass by and they come no more,<br />
But the bell still rings as it did of yore.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
And I think to-day as I hear it ring<br />
That the fame men crave is a fleeting thing.<br />
Unchanged, unswayed by the pomps men praise,<br />
The old clock high in its tower stays,<br />
Sounding the hours for the great and low<br />
As it sounded them in the long ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
So when the throngs that are here pass by<br />
And the pride of to-day in the dust shall lie,<br />
When the new crowds come in their search for power,<br />
The self-same clock in the self-same tower<br />
Shall still ring out in the city block,<br />
For them, as for us, it is ten o'clock.<br />

Our friends have automobiles now.  The summer cottage where we went<br />
To rest beside the water's blue in peace and indolent content<br />
Is but an hour's swift ride away.  So bright and early Sunday morn<br />
Before the breakfast eggs are cooked, we hear the honking of the horn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We must have bathing suits for ten, although our family numbers four;<br />
Beds must be made for all who come, though father sleeps upon the floor;<br />
Dishes and knives and forks and spoons are gathered in one huge display,<br />
For we must be prepared to feed the visitors who come our way.<br />

From Friday noon till Monday morn full many a weary trip I take,<br />
Rowing the women and their babes upon the bosom of the lake;<br />

I must, until they say good-bye, do everything they wish to do.<br />

<p class="poem">
My son, beware of "good enough,"<br />
It isn't made of sterling stuff;<br />
It's something any man can do,<br />
It marks the many from the few,<br />
It has no merit to the eye,<br />
It's something any man can buy,<br />
Its name is but a sham and bluff,<br />
For it is never "good enough."<br />

<p class="poem">
With "good enough" the shirkers stop<br />
In every factory and shop;<br />
With "good enough" the failures rest<br />
And lose to men who give their best;<br />
With "good enough" the car breaks down<br />
And men fall short of high renown.<br />
My son, remember and be wise,<br />
In "good enough" disaster lies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
With "good enough" have ships been wrecked,<br />
The forward march of armies checked,<br />
Great buildings burned and fortunes lost;<br />
Nor can the world compute the cost<br />
In life and money it has paid<br />
Because at "good enough" men stayed.<br />
Who stops at "good enough" shall find<br />
Success has left him far behind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There is no "good enough" that's short<br />
Of what you can do and you ought.<br />
The flaw which may escape the eye<br />
And temporarily get by,<br />
Shall weaken underneath the strain<br />
And wreck the ship or car or train,<br />
For this is true of men and stuff&mdash;<br />
Only the best is "good enough."<br />

  <i>The Chimney Piece</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
I would not, if I could, recall some customs that are gone.<br />
I'm glad that wreath of immortelles I need not look upon&mdash;<br />
That cold, imperishable thing of wax, in colors gay.<br />
Which hung upon the parlor wall in Grandma's earlier day,<br />
No longer shrieks its warning grim that mortal life must cease&mdash;<br />
And yet I'm sorry we have lost the old-time chimney piece.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The modern mantel, I admit, is striking to the eye,<br />
And yet it lacks the wealth of charm we knew in days gone by;<br />
For on the little marble shelf above the grate fire's glow<br />
Were all the sacred treasures of the homestead in a row,<br />
The pictures and the onyx clock, the globe of native birds,<br />
Which told the things we loved the most in clearer speech than words.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There Mother kept in tenderness the trinkets of the years,<br />
The tokens of her happier days, the symbols of her tears;<br />
The glossy cabinet photographs, the candlesticks of brass,<br />
The picture of Niagara Falls blown into heavy glass,<br />
And there above the grate fire's glow, for every eye to see,<br />
Were all the sacred treasures from her book of memory.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But Time has swept these things away, the mantel now is bare.<br />
The attic dust lies thick upon the joys once valued there;<br />
The photographs are stored away, the birds long since have flown,<br />
Nor is it now good form to show the treasured things we own,<br />
For when the newer customs come, the ones of old must cease,<br />
And yet I'm sorry that we had to lose the chimney piece.<br />

Out of the darkness and the gloom,<br />

A little braver when the skies are gray,<br />

A little kinder, both of thought and deed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little gentler with the old and weak,<br />

These are my goals&mdash;not flung beyond my power,<br />

These I can do and be from day to day<br />

<i>The Carpet on the Stairs</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Let others sing in modern ways, it's joy enough for me<br />
To sing in good old-fashioned rhyme the days that used to be.<br />
The page of boyhood's scribbled full with things we used to do,<br />
The fun we had, the games we played, the little tasks we knew,<br />
And back to mind there comes today the hardest of our cares,<br />
That springtime job of putting down the carpet on the stairs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Housecleaning time meant weary legs and hands and aching backs,<br />
For no more tedious job there is than driving carpet tacks.<br />
Then mother told us what to do, and on our hands and knees<br />
We stretched and hauled and pulled and tugged and did our best to please;<br />
But, oh!  I well remember now one task which patience wears,<br />
That awkward, muscle straining job of carpeting the stairs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We'd start upon the topmost step and let the carpet roll,<br />
But then began a feat of strength to try the bravest soul.<br />
The corners must be folded so and stretched and firmly tacked,<br />
With mother watching every move as down the stairs we backed;<br />
And many a time we've reached the end, discovering there and then<br />
It wouldn't do at all that way and must be laid again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
No more we break our finger nails and set our knees on fire<br />
In stretching carpets on the floors, no more our muscles tire;<br />
No more the mother stands above our bended forms to see<br />
That every tack is driven home the way it ought to be.<br />
The times are very different now, and no one ever shares<br />
The joy and pain of long ago, while carpeting the stairs.<br />

<p class="poem">
Winters are not what they used to be in the cities of haste and rush;<br />
The snow is white for a little while, then turns to an ugly slush.<br />
And the rapid wheels of the motor cars grind all of its beauty down&mdash;<br />
But I long for the horse and cutter days we knew in the little town.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then the world stayed white for a month or two and the snow drifts higher grew<br />
And cheeks were pink with the glow of health and the joys we youngsters knew,<br />
Then sleigh bells added a merry lilt to the cold and crispy air<br />
And youth and maid in an open sleigh were always a happy pair.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We hitched a ride to the runners strong and the snow flew from our feet,<br />
But it's dangerous now to hitch a ride on the dark and crowded street,<br />
And the raucous honk of the motor horn has banished the sleigh bell's song,<br />
For winter days are cheerless now and winter nights are long.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Perhaps it's well that our customs change and good that we travel on,<br />
But blent with the smiles of our newer joys are sighs for the pleasures gone,<br />

For the cheeks of pink and the laughter gay of our horse and cutter days.<br />

<p class="poem">
A lilac bush is a lovely thing<br />
Wherever it blossoms in early spring,<br />
But I have a tenderer regard<br />
For the old-time bush in an old-time yard,<br />
With the house near-by and the youngsters flown,<br />
And the old folks living there all alone,<br />
For always I fancy I can see<br />
The visions that cling to the lilac tree.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The house still stands, but the walls are still,<br />
And the storms have battered each window sill;<br />
There's a tired, worn look on the humble place,<br />
Like the weary look on the mother's face,<br />
Yet somehow or other I seem to know<br />
That joy reigned here in the long ago,<br />
And somehow or other I seem to see<br />
The dreams which cling to the lilac tree.<br />

<p class="poem">
Time was those feeble hands were strong<br />
And the faltering footsteps danced along;<br />
Time was youth romped in that lonely place,<br />
But never the years will halt their pace,<br />
And the young must go, but the old will cling<br />
To the home they've loved to the final Spring,<br />
For they hear the laughter that used to be,<br />
When the bloom comes back to the lilac tree.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
A lilac bush is a lovely thing<br />
Wherever it blossoms in early spring,<br />
But, bent with age and the smiles and tears<br />
Which come to all with the passing years,<br />

Of the golden days of the long ago,<br />
For all that remains of the youth long gone<br />
Is the lilac tree still blossoming on.<br />

The way you walk gives me a fit!<br />
Those shoes were new a week ago<br />
An' now you've busted out the toe."<br />

<p class="poem">
They're always peckin' at me, too,<br />
For standin' like the fellers do.<br />

If I get nervous an' I put<br />
One shoe upon the other foot,<br />

Ma says: "Don't put your feet up there!"<br />
An' if I sit on them they roar:<br />
"Please put your feet upon the floor!"<br />

I'm gettin' tired of all this talk<br />
About the way I stand or walk,<br />

Taking medicine to-day isn't what it used to be.<br />
Castor oil is castor oil, but they've banished senna tea,<br />
And they've sugar coated now all the bitter things we took,<br />

Brewing up a remedy for the ailments which we knew,<br />

But I vow the worst of all remedies they gave to me<br />
Was that gummy, sticky stuff known and served as flaxseed tea.<br />

Getting well is easy now.  Take your medicine and smile,<br />

<i>The Tumbler at the Sink</i><br />

<p class="poem">
The houses of the rich folks are very fine to see,<br />
But after all I fancy they'd never do for me&mdash;<br />
For a butler guards the doorway, and a staff of servants wait<br />
To gratify your slightest wish, like messengers of state.<br />
They're there to do your bidding, and should you want a drink<br />
They'll never let you get it from the tumbler at the sink.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now it may be I'm old fashioned, but to really feel at home,<br />
I like to be permitted all around the house to roam,<br />
And I like to find the kitchen, with the towel upon the door,<br />
And the gayly colored picture from the corner grocery store.<br />
There's a comfortable feeling which the great folks miss, I think,<br />
In drinking, when you're thirsty, from the tumbler at the sink.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There's a charm about the kitchen which no other room can boast,<br />
And when you think about it, it's the one we need the most.<br />
It is there we find her smiling when we come back home at night,<br />
There the children dance about her as they're pleading for a bite,<br />
And it's there that eyes are brightest, cheeks the pinkest of the pink,<br />
And it's there, for all the thirsty, there's the tumbler at the sink.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flourish in the catalogues;<br />
The humblest vine that's planted there<br />
Blossoms without the slightest care.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There are no withered stalks to see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pitiful attempts to thrive,<br />
No shrub that struggles desperately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the sun and stay alive.<br />
In catalogues the larkspur seems<br />
To match the gardener's fondest dreams.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The red geranium is strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its clump of blossom full and round,<br />
No windstorm ever comes along<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sweep the cosmos to the ground,<br />
No youngster ever bats a ball<br />
Among the roses, straight and tall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I turn the pages o'er and o'er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the pansies dark as wine,<br />
And think, as I have thought before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are superior to mine;<br />
In my poor garden, never yet<br />
Has bloomed such lovely mignonette.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Since pansies have the storms to face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men must battle day by day,<br />
They cannot wear the charm and grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their printed catalogues display;<br />
Life is much sterner than it looks<br />
And scars are seldom shown in books.<br />

<i>Old-Fashioned Dinners</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It wasn't too much work for her in the days of long ago<br />
To get a dinner ready for a dozen friends or so;<br />
The mother never grumbled at the cooking she must do<br />
Or the dusting or the sweeping, but she seemed to smile it through,<br />
And the times that we were happiest, beyond the slightest doubt,<br />
Were when good friends were coming and we stretched the table out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We never thought, when we were young, to take our friends away<br />
And entertain them at a club or in some swell cafe;<br />
When mother gave a dinner, she would plan it all herself<br />
And feed the people that she liked, the best things on the shelf.<br />
Then one job always fell to me, for I was young and stout,<br />
I brought the leaves to father when he stretched the table out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
That good old-fashioned table.  I can see it still to-day<br />
With its curious legs of varnished oak round which I used to play;<br />
It wasn't much to look at, not as stylish or refined<br />
Or as costly or as splendid as the oval, modern kind,<br />
But it always had a welcome for our friends to sit about,<br />
And though twenty guests were coming, we could always stretch it out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I learned it from my mother&mdash;it is foolish pride to roam,<br />
The only place to entertain your friends is right at home.<br />
Just let them in by dozens, let them laugh and sing and play<br />
And come to love and know them in the good old-fashioned way;<br />
Home's the place for fun and friendship, home's the place where joy may shout,<br />
And if you crowd our dining room, we'll stretch the table out.<br />

<i>The Dreamer</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The road lay straight before him, but the by-paths smiled at him<br />
And the scarlet poppies called him to the forests cool and dim,<br />
And the song birds' happy chorus seemed to lure him further on;<br />
'Twas a day of wondrous pleasure&mdash;but the day was quickly gone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
He could not resist the laughter and the purling of a brook<br />
Any more than gray old sages can resist some dusty book,<br />
And though stern-faced duty bade him march the highway straight ahead,<br />
"The trees are better company than busy men," he said.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
We wondered at his dreaming and his wanderings far astray,<br />
But we were counting values by the gold and silver way,<br />
And sometimes as I saw him gazing idly at the sky,<br />
I fancied he had pleasures of a sort I couldn't buy.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I fancy he saw something in the clouds above the trees<br />
Which the gold and glory seeker passes by and never sees,<br />
And I think he gathered something from the woods and running streams<br />
Which is just as good as money to the man of many dreams.<br />

<i>Hot Mince Pie</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I stood upon the coping of the tallest building known<br />
And tried to walk that dangerous ledge, bare-footed and alone.<br />
I started very bravely, then I turned to look behind<br />
And saw a demon coming of the most ferocious kind;<br />
He bade me get a move on, and I started in to run<br />
And I slipped and lost my balance, and I knew that I was done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I had a wild encounter with a mad and awful beast,<br />
His eyes were bulged with malice, for he'd picked me for a feast.<br />
I tried to scream, but couldn't.  Then he growled a fearful note<br />
And gave one spring towards me and his fangs sank in my throat,<br />
One gulp and it was over&mdash;it was much too black to see,<br />
But I knew beyond all question that the end had come for me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I tumbled from an aeroplane and looped and looped around,<br />
And was twenty-seven minutes on my journey to the ground;<br />
I bumped a dozen steeples on my perilous descent<br />
And left as many flagstaffs either snapped in two or bent&mdash;<br />
But when I woke, in terror, I discovered with a sigh<br />
How much of real excitement lurks in mother's hot mince pie.<br />

Laughed at the prayer that the preacher spoke<br />

<i>Apples Ripe for Eating</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Apples ripe for eating, and the grate fire blazing high,<br />
And outside the moon of autumn fairly swimming in the sky;<br />
The cellar packed with good things from the vine and field and tree&mdash;<br />
Oh, the speech of man can't tell it, but it somehow seems to me<br />
With such warmth and cheer around us, we should all burst into song<br />
And store enough of gladness now to last our whole lives long.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Apples ripe for eating&mdash;there's a joy beyond compare<br />
To pay for all our trouble and the burdens we must bear!<br />
The bowl upon the table filled with round and rosy cheeks,<br />
And enough down in the cellar to last all the winter weeks,<br />
So that when the bowl is empty we can fill it up again&mdash;<br />
And in spite of that we grumble and we bitterly complain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I sometimes sit and wonder as we pack life's fruits away<br />
And hoard them in the cellar for the bleak and wintry day,<br />
Why the mind of man has never tried to store a stock of cheer<br />
In the cellar of his memory for the barren time of year,<br />
So that when joy's bowl is emptied and he thinks that life is vain,<br />
He can seek his hoard of pleasures and just fill it up again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Apples ripe for eating and a stock of them below<br />
For the long cold nights of winter we shall shortly come to know,<br />
So that when we need a pleasure that will seem to soothe the soul<br />
We can wander to the cellar and fill up the apple bowl;<br />
So we could, if we were mindful, when our hearts with grief are sad,<br />
Refresh our faltering courage with the pleasures we have had.<br />

Got to sit an' wait an' wait<br />

Then walk slowly down stairs an'<br />
Try to be a gentleman.<br />

<i>The Carving Knife</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When I was but a little lad, my father carved what meat we had;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With grace and skill he'd cut and slice the roast of beef or veal,<br />
With dexterous hand he'd wield the blade, no false or awkward &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move he made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deftly he could whet the knife upon his shining steel.<br />
But now and then I'd hear him say: "Who's used my carving knife today?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What woman's used this blade of mine for cutting wire or tin?"<br />
And on this special point he'd harp: "a carving weapon must be sharp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or one can never cut a roast and have the slices thin."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"That knife must not be used on string, or bread or boards or anything&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands off my carving blade," he'd cry, and yet I grieve to say,<br />
In spite of all his warnings grim, the women paid no heed to him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used his sacred carving knife a dozen times a day.<br />
They'd use that knife for cutting soap, old carpets, leather &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belts and rope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd use it too, for pulling tacks and leave it dulled and nicked,<br />
And every time a meal began, my father was an angry man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But vain was every oath he swore and every kick he kicked.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Now like my good old dad I stand, and take the carving knife in hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And run my thumb along its edge and find it dulled and nicked,<br />
And like my good old dad I vow some day there'll be a healthy row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm as unsuccessful as my father when he kicked.<br />
The maid, the youngsters and the wife still take that sacred &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carving knife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use it as a handy tool on wood or lead or stone;<br />
In spite of all I do or say, the blade is dulled from day to day,<br />

To have them say how very glad<br />
Their youthful lives were made by dad.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I want them to recall this place<br />
As one of charm and tender grace,<br />
To love these walls of calm content<br />
Wherein their youthful years were spent,<br />
And feel through each succeeding year,<br />
They lived their happiest moments here.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
I feel I shall have failed unless<br />
This house shall shelter happiness.<br />
Save they shall find their truest mirth<br />
Around their father's humble hearth,<br />
And here life's finest joys attain,<br />
I shall have lived my life in vain.<br />

  <i>Spring Fever</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
When the blue gets back in the skies once more<br />
And the vines grow green 'round the kitchen door,<br />
When the roses bud and the robins come,<br />
I stretch myself and I say: "Ho-hum!<br />
I ought to work but I guess I won't;<br />
Though some want riches to-day, I don't;<br />
This looks to me like the sort of day<br />
That was made to idle and dream away."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When the sun is high and the air just right,<br />
With the trees all blossomy, pink and white,<br />
And the grass, as soft as a feather bed<br />
With the white clouds drifting just overhead,<br />
I stretch and yawn like a school boy then,<br />
And turn away from the walks of men<br />
And tell myself in a shamefaced way:<br />
"I'm going to play hookey from work to-day!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Here is a morning too rare to miss,<br />
And what is gold to a day like this,<br />
And what is fame to the things I'll see<br />
Through the lattice-work of a fine old tree?<br />
There is work to do, but the work can wait;<br />
There are goals to reach, there are foes to hate,<br />
There are hurtful things which the smart might say,<br />
But nothing like that shall spoil to-day."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"To-day I'll turn from the noisy town<br />
And just put all of my burdens down;<br />
I'll quit the world and its common sense,<br />
And the things men think are of consequence,<br />
To chum with birds and the friendly trees<br />
And try to fathom their mysteries,<br />
For here is a day which looks to be<br />
The kind I can fritter away on me."<br />

<p class="poem">
It's oh, my little laddie, as you're romping at your play<br />
There's an old heart running with you every minute of the day;<br />
And though you cannot see me when you're wrapped up in a game,<br />
But it's I that am beside you in your striving just the same.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It is oh, my little laddie, there is much you cannot know,<br />
But it's I that follow proudly everywhere you chance to go;<br />
There's a hand upon your shoulder, wheresoever you may be,<br />
That would help you out of danger, and that hand belongs to me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It is oh, my little laddie, though you cannot hear me call,<br />
I am always there to help you every time you chance to fall;<br />
I am with you in the school room and I'm with you on the street,<br />
And though you may not know it, I am dogging at your feet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
It's oh, my little laddie, all my life belongs to you,<br />
All the dreams that I have cherished through the years depend on you;<br />
And though now you cannot know it, you shall some day come to see<br />
How this old heart loved to hover 'round a boy that used to be.<br />

<p class="poem">
A possible man of affairs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible leader of men,<br />
Back of the grin that he wears<br />

Heedless and mischievous now,<br />

A skill that the world shall admire,<br />

He with the freckles and tan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with that fun-loving grin,<br />
May rise to great heights as a man<br />

Back of the slang of the streets<br />

<i>I Don't Want to Go to Bed</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
World wide over this is said:<br />
"I don't want to go to bed."<br />
Dads and mothers, far and near,<br />
Every night this chorus hear;<br />
Makes no difference where they are,<br />
Here or off in Zanzibar,<br />
In the igloos made of snow<br />
Of the fur-clad Eskimo,<br />
In this blistering torrid zone,<br />
This one touch of nature's known;<br />
In life's various tongues it's said:<br />
"I don't want to go to bed!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
This has ever been the way<br />
Of the youngsters at their play.<br />
Laughter quickly dries their tears,<br />
Trouble swiftly disappears,<br />
Joy is everywhere about,<br />
Here and there and in and out;<br />
Yet when night comes on they cry<br />
That so glad a day should die,<br />
And they think that they will miss<br />
Something more of precious bliss,<br />
So shouts every curly-head:<br />
"I don't want to go to bed!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Age is glad to put away<br />
All the burdens of the day,<br />
Glad to lay the worries down,<br />
Quit the noises of the town,<br />
And in slumber end the care<br />
That has met them here and there.<br />
But the children do not know<br />
Life is freighted down with woe;<br />
They would run until they drop,<br />
Hoping day would never stop,<br />
Calling back when it has fled:<br />
"I don't want to go to bed."<br />

<i>Morning Brigands</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There may be happier times than this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there are I've never known them,<br />
When youngsters jump in bed to kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wake the pa's and ma's who own them.<br />
What if the sun be up or not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another perfect day is dawning,<br />
And is it not a happy lot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such delight to greet the morning?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Sometimes I hear them quit their bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch their bare-foot pitter-patter,<br />
And other times they're at my head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I know what is the matter.<br />
Brigands to rob us of our sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They come&mdash;their weapons love and laughter,<br />
And though we're locked in slumber deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always get the joy they're after.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Some days there are when we would lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream our dreams a little longer,<br />
Then "back to bed awhile," we cry&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh, our love for them is stronger,<br />
Yes, stronger than our wish to sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we countermand the order<br />
And let that pair of brigands leap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wild delight across love's border.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There may be happier times than this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there are I've never known them,<br />
When youngsters jump in bed to kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wake the pa's and ma's who own them.<br />
They miss a lot, the man and wife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never feel those glad hands shake them,<br />
Who rise by day to toil and strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But have no little tots to wake them.<br />

<i>Grief's Only Master</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Into the lives of all<br />
The tears of sorrow fall.<br />
Into the happiest hearts<br />
Grief drives her darts;<br />
No door however stout<br />
Can shut Death's angel out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Vain are the things we prize,<br />
Treasure and pomp's disguise;<br />
They cannot stay the tear<br />
When the true griefs appear.<br />
Where Death will strike to-day<br />
Gold cannot bar the way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There is no joy secure,<br />
No peace that shall endure,<br />
No smile that man shall keep.<br />
God wills that he must weep,<br />
And in his darkest hour<br />
Vain is all earthly power.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
What, then, should guard the gate?<br />
How shall a man be great?<br />
Through the dark days and long,<br />
What power shall make him strong?<br />
Wherein does courage lie,<br />
Since all he loves must die?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When sorrow binds his hands,<br />
Helpless the strong man stands.<br />
One master only grief<br />
Bows to, and that's belief&mdash;<br />
Faith that he'll some day know<br />
Why God hath willed it so!<br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
